- here are two options for same solution (function which takes an n, and return the sam of all
givven number). 
so if n = 3, 1+2+3 = 6;
/***************************
function addUpTo(n) {
    let total = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        total += i;
    }

    return total;

}


function addUpTo(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

/***************************

- the second options is faster and more efficient in terms of performance. 
- one way of calculate our time, is by using the performance() method
  but it is not something that we can usally do, as if we would have a large app 
  which takes an hour to run, we can not afford to use it and compare it to other process 
  which can run 4 hours or so.
- so there is another way to achive this.
