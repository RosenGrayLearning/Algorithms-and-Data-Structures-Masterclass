- Base Case - the most important rule in recursive functions; we have to define a base case, which means : when the recursion stops.
- Different input - a second rule - the function should be called each time with a different input.

function countDown(num){
  if(num <= 0){
    //Our base case - stopping point
    console.log('we are done');
    return;
  }
  console.log(num);
  num--;
  countDown(num);
}


countDown(10)
